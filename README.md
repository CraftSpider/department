A Rust library hosting a possible implementation of the proposed Storages API,
as well as several of the standard `std` collections implemented with it.

Inspired by [storage-poc](https://github.com/matthieu-m/storage-poc), re-implemented
and built upon to provide (hopefully) release-ready functionality.
